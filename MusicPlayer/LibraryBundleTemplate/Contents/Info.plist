        Notes:
        - This Info.plist is used as the minimal Contents/Info.plist inside a created `.library` bundle.
        - The app should create a directory named `YourName.library` and copy these Contents/Resources files inside.
        - For Finder to present the directory as a package, you should also declare a UTI in the app's Info.plist
          where the UTI (e.g. `com.vibez.musiclibrary`) conformsTo `com.apple.package` and associates the
          filename extension `library` with that UTI (see IMPLEMENTATION.md/README for details).
